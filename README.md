# onboarder-modernization
Slightly longer “About” / README intro  This repo showcases a full modernization of an internal employee onboarding/offboarding system. On one side: a legacy ASP.NET MVC app with Razor, jQuery amd bad practices all around. On the other: a modern, cloud-ready .NET 8 / Blazor solution using clean architecture.
